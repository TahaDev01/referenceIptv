                    <p>
                        Boot-Coding is committed to protecting the privacy and personal information of its users. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose personal information when you use our website and interact with our services, including the integration with Stripe for payment processing.

                        Collection of Personal Information:
                        
                        When you use our website and purchase courses, we may collect personal information such as your name, email address, billing address, and payment details. This information is necessary to process your orders and provide you with access to the courses.
                        Use of Personal Information:
                        
                        We use the personal information collected during the payment process to facilitate the transaction, process payments, and deliver the purchased courses to you. We may also use your email address to communicate with you regarding your orders and provide updates on our services.
                        Stripe Integration:
                        
                        In order to process payments, we integrate with Stripe, a third-party payment processor. When you provide your payment information, it is securely transmitted to Stripe for payment processing. We do not store or have access to your full payment card details.
                        Data Security:
                        
                        We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information and maintain the security of our website. However, please note that no method of transmission or storage over the internet is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of your information.
                        Data Retention:
                        
                        We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
                        Third-Party Services:
                        
                        Our website may contain links to third-party websites or services. This privacy policy does not apply to those websites or services, and we are not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those third parties.
                        Updates to Privacy Policy:
                        
                        We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the updated policy on our website. We recommend
